# Business Site

This is my business site. It's for a made-up pastry chef that holds master classes in piping. 

The assignment was to make a business site with a hero image,  a form and an accordion.

## The problem

I started with choosing a hero image and a theme and went from there. My focus was to get the form and accordion to function. I put less effort into the layout. I used the provided javascript function toggle() both for expanding and collapsing the accordion as well as for changing the plus icons to minus icons as the accordion sections expand. If I had had more time I would try to imitate the looks of some nice-looking form and accordion. I would also try to make a better desktop layout.
